AAL (AMarkets Affiliate Links) will replace old broken AMarkets affiliate links with new working ones.

It is often updated to ensure you always have good working links.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin break my database? =

No. AAL does not change database at all, links are changed on-the-fly. It case you are in doubt, just disable AAL, everything will be just as it was before.

= Will it slow down my site? =

No. AAL does not add any scripts, styles or any other files. It just changes a piece of text(link) to other text(link). This is really-really fast. You will not be able to notice the difference when it's enabled or disabled speed-wise.

AAL requires at least PHP 5.3 or higher to work. That is a very old version of PHP, you should be using PHP 7+, or at least PHP 5.6 anyway.
